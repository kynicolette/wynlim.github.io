There was this episode in "Scandal" where someone was wrongfully shot down by the FBI because he was actually a spy working to inflitrate enemy organizations. His mother couldn't even know, and she died thinking her son was a terrorist.

I often wonder how many people in this world do what they do even though they will never be seen or acknowledged for it. I also often question myself if I would do what I do if I would never be seen, understood or recognized. There's this old philosophical question along the same lines, "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

I think it is important to consistently question my own motives and agenda for pursuing my goals. It is incredible how easy to lose sight of one's original identity and purpose. I want to be the person who tried my darnest to live life, and not the person who tried her best to be successful based on societal terms.

Life loves the person who dares to live it, says Maya Angelou. Plenty of times feeling alive or doing what truly matters come at a price of never being seen or understood and this is where the genuine love of one's self and life comes into play. 

Ultimately it does not matter who sees you if you cannot see yourself.
