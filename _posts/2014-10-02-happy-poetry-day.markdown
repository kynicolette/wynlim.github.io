how do we hold on  
when there is no beginning and an end  
how do I let go  
of a hand I never had

but stories are ruthlessly binding  
despite skipping the now and then  
how does one unfold the words  
without the pages to bend

_because I promised myself that I will publish my poetry even if it sucks_
